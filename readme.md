### What we are about

The protagonist in the unbundling of the music industry is PlaylistDAOâ€“a legion of fans that does more than resist, it
moves. The industry is stealing from artists and has tried to confine them to narrow stereotypes optimized for max
clicks & streams. But now, we have tools to turn that industry on its head.

BUiDL. As a DAO, we stockpile resources + ideas to take back the music meant for fans. HodL. Through NFTs, we redefine
ownership, collecting, and artist patronage. PLAY. Our community will vibe online & IRL (our venues are sanctuaries) as
avante-garde pioneers raising hell in the most gratifying of ways.

The Web3 music ecosystem is a near-blank canvas that awaits our imprint. Time is short. Music needs you.
